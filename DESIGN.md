# Application Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture of the AI Recipe Generator Web App, including frontend, backend, and database components.

## Frontend
The frontend will be developed using [Insert Frontend Framework, e.g., React]. It handles user interactions, ingredient input, and displays recipe suggestions. Key components include:
- **Ingredient Input Component**: Handles text input from users.
- **Recipe Display Component**: Shows AI-generated recipes with details like images, cooking time, and ratings.

## Backend
The backend will be developed using [Insert Backend Framework, e.g., Node.js with Express]. It processes ingredient input, interacts with the AI model for recipe generation, and serves API requests to the frontend. Key functionalities include:
- **API Endpoints**: For ingredient processing and recipe retrieval.
- **AI Integration**: Connects with an AI model to generate recipes based on input ingredients.

## Database
The database will be implemented using [Insert Database System, e.g., MongoDB]. It stores user data, ingredients, and generated recipes. Key collections/tables include:
- **Users**: Stores user information and preferences.
- **Recipes**: Stores generated recipes with details.

## Data Flow
The data flow consists of user input being sent to the backend, processed by the AI model, and stored in the database. The results are then sent back to the frontend for display.
